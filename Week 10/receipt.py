A local grocery store subscribes to an online service 
that enables its customers to order groceries online. 
After a customer completes an order, the online service 
sends a CSV file that contains the customerâ€™s requests to 
the grocery store. The store needs you to write a program 
that reads the CSV file and prints to the terminal window 
a receipt that lists the purchased items and shows the subtotal, 
the sales tax amount, and the total.
